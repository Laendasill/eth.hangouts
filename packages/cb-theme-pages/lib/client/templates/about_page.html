<h3>Why?</h3>
<p>If we can build a better system, then more than 2 billion people will have a way to regain control over their information, privacy and digital lives. This is an important goal, worthy of time, attention and commitment. Besides this, if things go well, on the next Internet we’ll have more cats and less NSA. And who doesn’t like cats? ^_^</p>

<h3>What is Ethereum?</h3>
<p>Ethereum is a 100% crowd founded, open source technology created out of necessity for a transparent and trustworthy foundation on which we can rebuild and heal the Internet. It is envisioned as a platform that enables people to easily build decentralized applications, transparent and trustworthy by design. You can find more info on it in our GitBook (link here) or on the Ethereum Wiki (link here)</p>

<div id="faq-why"></div>
<h3>What is Ethereum Builders?</h3>
<p> Ethereum builders is a self organizing community that thrives on knowledge sharing, mass collaboration and solution-oriented thinking. Use your creative freedom, identify what inspires you, own it, and push it. Take risks, learn from your mistakes, and most of all, have fun. You are not only welcome to experiment here but encouraged to do so. From messaging applications that don't read your conversations to unforgeable voting systems, an entire multi-verse of possibilities and applications is waiting to be explored by the brave and open-minded.</p>

<h3>Who can join?</h3>
<p>Anyone can sign up as long as you have an internet connection! You don't need to be or aspire to be a career programmer. <strong>Ethereum literacy is for everyone.</strong></p>

<div id="faq-who"></div>
<h3>What makes Ethereum Builders different from Stackoverflow or a course?</h3>
<ol>
<li>First of all, we don’t have a Stackoverflow for ethereum as of now. In the meantime, as a replacement, we have created <strong>this <a href="http://forum.ethereum.builders/c/q-a" target="_blank">category</a> on our forums.</strong></li>
<li>Unlike static text or recorded courses, the learning happens peer-to-peer via audio and screen sharing. You learn from others, and also validate your understanding of ethereum when you find yourself explaining concepts to others running into the same questions you once ran into.</li>
<li>Everyone at the hangout is chatting about a specific topic or tutorial determined by the person who proposed the 1 or 2 hour-long study session.</li>
<li>The experience may not be as rigorous as that of a coding bootcamp or paid course because meeting times are flexible; you can propose a series of hangouts to finish an entire free online book, but not everyone may stick with it until the end.</li>
<li>The topics and times for study sessions can be proposed by any member of the community.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Do I need to pay anything?</h3>
<p><strong>No.</strong> It's a free and safe space. We help each other out. On the other hand, if you want to support our work tips and donations are welcomed at: 1PMkXXVCzF7LxYUfi8fescx2ne8vgiBYTd</p>

<div id="faq-whose"></div>
<h3>What should I do when I join one of the Google Hangouts?</h3>
<ol>
<li>Turn off your video camera to save on bandwidth.</li>
<li>Screen share by clicking on the green icon on the left (and the first window that appears after that). If everyone shares their screens, we can help each other more easily, see what we've each coded, and also be able to point out what we're talking about more easily.</li>
<li>Take turns talking through the code out loud. Give everyone a chance to speak and ask questions. A good number for an efficient study session, in fact, is between 2-6 people -- all looking at the same shared screen or working through the same exercise(s).</li>
</ol>

<h3>What's the inspiration behind ethereum.builders?</h3>
<p>The number of resources available online for anyone who wants to learn to code on their own is vast, but it can be quite frustrating for a beginner the first time they set up a development environment, touch the command line, fix a merge conflict in git, miss a semicolon, or find that a section of a tutorial they were following is outdated.</p>
<p>Oftentimes, people -- mentors, co-workers, hackathon buddies, and study partners -- are key to accelerating one's learning. But not everyone has access to study partners or mentors/co-workers who can help them. This is our attempt to solve this problem.</p>
<p>The platform was envisioned as a solution to the pains of managing mailing lists and calendar invites for organizing programming learning sessions. Special thanks go to <a href="https://twitter.com/lpnotes" target="_blank">Linda Peng</a> for launching codebudies.org under an open source license and to <a href="https://twitter.com/awrelllRo" target="_blank">Aurel Iancu</a> for morphing it into what it looks like today.</p>
