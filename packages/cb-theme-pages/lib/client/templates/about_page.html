<blockquote>"In times of change, learners inherit the earth, while the learned find themselves beautifully equipped to deal with a world that no longer exists."
<cite>Eric Hoffer</cite></blockquote>

<p>Ethereum is a 100% crowd founded, open source technology created out of necessity for a transparent and trustworthy foundation on which we can rebuild and heal the Internet. It is envisioned as a platform that enables people to easily build decentralized applications, transparent and trustworthy by design.</p>

<p>Ethereum builders is a self organizing community that thrives on knowledge sharing, mass collaboration and solution-oriented thinking. Use your creative freedom, identify what inspires you, own it, and push it. Take risks, learn from your mistakes, and most of all, have fun.</p>

<p>You are not only welcome to experiment here but encouraged to do so. From messaging applications that don't read your conversations to unforgeable voting systems, an entire multi-verse of possibilities and applications is waiting to be explored by the brave and open-minded.</p>

<p>If we can build a better system, then more than 2 billion people will have a way to regain control over their information, privacy and digital lives. This is an important goal, worthy of time, attention and commitment. Besides this, if things go well, on the next Internet we’ll have more cats and less NSA. And who doesn’t like cats? ^_^</p>
<h3>Our values</h3>
<p>Our values converge in a culture that revolves around exploration, creativity, problem solving, and a willingness to push fast and iterate. We work hard as a team, have fun as a team, and we never take ourselves too seriously.</p>

<h4>Transparency</h4>
<p>Transparency is the foundation for building trust in an open network. Transparent community-based processes promote participation, accountability and trust.</p>

<h4>Meritocracy</h4>
<p>In a meritocracy, the best ideas win. Each person’s value comes from his or her individuality and uniqueness and the capacity to engage and interact with others to make the fruits of that uniqueness available. Successful work determines which projects rise and gather effort from the community.</p>

<h4>Open Information</h4>
<p>A free exchange of ideas is critical to creating an environment where people are allowed to learn and use existing information toward creating new ideas. Spawned from this core idea, free and open source software promotes the development of the Internet as an open and trustworthy public resource.</p>

<h4>Open collaboration</h4>
<p>When we are free to collaborate we can solve problems that no one person may be able to solve on their own and learn from each other in the process.</p>

<h4>Rapid Prototyping</h4>
<p>Learn by doing. Rapid prototypes can lead to rapid failures, but that leads to better solutions found faster. When you're free to experiment, you can look at problems in new ways and look for answers in new places.</p>

<h4>Pluralism & Diversity</h4>
<p>No one has done this before. This means that there is no "right" or "wrong" way of doing things and by definition it's a trial and error process. From each failed experiment we learn and improve for the next experiment.</p>

<h4>Practical idealism</h4>
<p>Technologies and solutions that can be generalized as world positive are worthy to be pursued and explored. When others ask why bother? we ask why not?</p>

<h3>What is ethereum.builders?</h3>
<p>We’re a passionate Etherean community sharing knowledge and common values. We learn Ethereum by hacking together. The project is free to join and <a href="https://github.com/lpatmo/codebuddies-platform" target="_blank">open-sourced.</a> </p>

<div id="faq-pay"></div>
<h3>Do I need to pay anything?</h3>
<p>No. It's a free and safe space. We help each other out. On the other hand, if you want to support our work donations are welcomed at:</p>

<div id="faq-why"></div>
<h3>What's the inspiration behind CodeBuddies.org?</h3>
<p> The number of resources available online for anyone who wants to learn to code on their own is vast, but it can be quite frustrating for a beginner the first time they set up a development environment, touch the command line, fix a merge conflict in git, miss a semicolon, or find that a section of a tutorial they were following is outdated.</p>
<p>Oftentimes, <em>people</em> -- mentors, co-workers, hackathon buddies, and study partners -- are key to accelerating one's learning. But not everyone has access to study partners or mentors/co-workers who can help them.</p>
<p>Special thanks go to @lpatmo for launching codebudies.org on January 1st 2015 under open source licensing as a solution to the pains of managing mailing lists and calendar invites for organizing programming learning sessions.</p>

<div id="faq-who"></div>
<h3>Who can join?</h3>
<p>Anyone can sign up as long as you have an internet connection! You don't need to <em>be</em> or aspire to be a career programmer. Ethereum literacy is for everyone.</p>

<h3>What should I do when I join one of the Google Hangouts?</h3>
<ol>
<li><strong>Turn off your video camera</strong> to save on bandwidth. </li>
<li><strong>Screen share</strong> by <img src="//codebuddies.org/images/icon-screenshare.png"/> clicking on the green icon on the left (and the first window that appears after that). If everyone shares their screens, we can help each other more easily, see what we've each coded, and also be able to point out what we're talking about more easily.</li>
<li><strong>At a study session tagged "SILENT HANGOUT",</strong> everyone turns off BOTH video and audio and works at their own pace on the topic proposed. Screenshare to share your progress, and use the chatroom to ask questions and help each other out. </li>
<li>At a non-silent hangout, <strong>take turns talking through the code out loud.</strong> Give everyone a chance to speak and ask questions. Google Hangouts lets multiple people screen share at the same time. </li>
</ol>

<h3>What makes ethereum.builders different from Stackoverflow or a course?</h3>
<ol>
<li>First of all, we don’t have a Stackoverflow for ethereum as of now. As a replacement we have created this <a href="http://forum.ethereum.builders/c/q-a">category</a></li>
<li>Unlike static text or recorded courses, the learning happens peer-to-peer via audio and screen sharing. You learn from others, and also validate your understanding of ethereum when you find yourself explaining concepts to others running into the same questions you once ran into.</li>
<li>Everyone at the hangout is chatting about a specific topic or tutorial determined by the person who proposed the 1 or 2-hour-long study session.</li>
<li>The experience may not be as rigorous as that of a coding bootcamp or paid course because meeting times are flexible; you can propose a series of hangouts to finish an entire free online book, but not everyone may stick with it until the end.</li>
<li>The topics and times for study sessions can be proposed by any member of the community.</li>
</ol>

<h3>What's the history behind CodeBuddies?</h3>
<p>Linda (<a href="http://bit.ly/1u7C0KQ">@lpnotes</a>) wanted to become a better web developer (and help others discover the joy of making things come alive on the internet, too). </p>
<p>CodeBuddies initially launched near the end of August 2014 as a set of Google Group mailing lists; the hangouts were proposed via individual google calendars. This setup was not ideal, since there was no way to see a list of all the upcoming hangouts, and one had to be invited to the Google Calendar in order to propose a new study session. The Google Group mailing lists did beget a lot of awesome knowledge sharing discussions, but there was no convenient way to search for them.</p>

<p>This platform (<a href="//hangouts.codebuddies.org">hangouts.codebuddies.org</a>) launched on January 1st, 2015 after at least 50 hangouts, one in-person meetup in NYC in October, some late Christmas-New Year's Eve week nights, and feedback from some smart people.</p> 

<h3>How do I help?</h3>
<p>The project is open-sourced, so check out the <a href="//github.com/lpatmo/codebuddies-platform" target="_blank">Github repo</a> if you want an "open-source contributor" badge to your title and are interested in fixing one of the <a href="#">bugs</a>. You can also <a href="//github.com/lpatmo/codebuddies-platform/issues" target="_blank">file a bug</a> yourself, or ask about a feature in the <a href="//gitter.im/lpatmo/codebuddies-hangouts" target="_blank">chatroom</a>.</p>

The best (and easiest) way to help, though, is to <a href="/submit">propose a study session</a>.
