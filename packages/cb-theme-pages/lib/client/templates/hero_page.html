    <h3>We're a community of "running partners" learning to code.</h3>
    <p>1. Studying a book/tutorial/online course and interested in finding remote study partners in real time?  <a href="/submit" class="submit btn header-submodule btn-primary top-submit">PROPOSE A NEW STUDY SESSION</a></p>
    <p>2. Click on the green <a class="hangout-button">Launch a hangout</a> button to join a Google Hangout study session at the time proposed based on the topic indicated in the title.</p>
    <p>3. If the study session is tagged <a href="http://hangouts.codebuddies.org/category/silent-hangout" class="post-category category-silent-hangout example">SILENT HANGOUT</a>, we'll turn off BOTH video and audio and work at our own pace. We may screen share while we work in real time if we're comfortable sharing our progress (or to help with debugging), and we'll use the chatroom to ask questions and help each other out.
    </p>
    <p>4. If the study session is NOT tagged <a href="http://hangouts.codebuddies.org/category/silent-hangout" class="post-category category-silent-hangout example">SILENT HANGOUT</a>, we'll turn off video only, mute the audio when we're not speaking, and work through coding exercises or read out loud a chapter together in real time. Use the chatroom to share helpful links, too.</p>
    <p>5. At the end of the session, leave a comment on the post to share what you learned! This can help you archive your progress.</p>
    <p>Ultimately, the goal at each study session is to master (and help each other master) the topic proposed.</p>
